# Introduction

This is an object-oriented project in BlueJ. The project uses lists of temperatures to calculate the daily average 
temperature at noon for the week. It also gives the date for the Sunday of the week and outputs 
what number week it is. Finally the project outputs a color associated for each average temperature.
This program is meant to be used with cross stitch, crochet, or knitting projects such as "temperature blankets".
